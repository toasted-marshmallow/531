# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Design of Experiments (DoE)
Sample of what I've used R for in the past for an ANOVA/DoE class I've taken in the past. The implementations in R includes creating tables, figures, statistical tests, statistical models, performing data cleaning. The main library used were mainly from the tidyverse library (dplyr, ggplot2, etc) and some other libraries.
